\section{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Mention how the concept of gradient-free optimization can be
        extended from rotational gates to controlled rotational gates.
    \item
        Mention the proof-of-concept implementation and its evaluation.
    \item
        Conclude whether these contributions are a
        significant improvement to the underlying optimization technique
        and compare its performance to other state-of-the-art optimizers.
    \item
        Present some ideas for future work.
        This might included the extension of this concept to even more
        gates, so that this approach can eventually cover a universal gate
        set to optimize arbitrary PQCs.
        % TODO: unproven guess: If we apply this to \tt{CCX} gates, we might
        %       be able to optimize arbitrary circuits with this approach.
        % note: future work must not be straight-forward and may branch out
        %       into different directions!
