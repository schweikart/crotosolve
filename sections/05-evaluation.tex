\section{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Evaluate the accuracy of the model, the number of steps in the
        optimization loop and the number of circuit evaluations
        \cite{wendenius_gradient-free_2023,ostaszewski_structure_2021}.
    \item
        Compare the results with the performance of other established
        optimizers (e.g., Adam \cite{kingma_adam_2017}, Gradient Descent and
        Quantum Natural Gradient \cite{stokes_quantum_2020}) as well as the
        \emph{Sine Exact} and \emph{Sine Iterative} variants proposed in
        \cite{wendenius_gradient-free_2023}.
        % TODO: sources for other optimizers
        For this purpose, evaluate at least the circuits from
        \cite{sim_expressibility_2019} that were also evaluated in the
        Wendenius et al. paper \cite{wendenius_gradient-free_2023}.
        % TODO: more circuits to evaluate? eileen might have access to
        %       something...
    \item
        Think about the effects of barren plateaus on this optimizer.
        % TODO: do think about this and come up with a concrete task!
        % TODO: cite barren plateaus
\end{itemize}
