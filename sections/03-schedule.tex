        }Develop optimization technique:
            Find the mathematical structure of
            \texttt{CRX}/\texttt{CRY}/\texttt{CRZ} parameter effects and develop
            an algorithm to find the optimal parameters

        }Implementation:
            Extend the optimizer from \cite{wendenius_gradient-free_2023} to
            include analytical optimizations for controlled rotation gates
            & 3 weeks

        }Evaluation:
            Gather a set of training demo problems and run experiments to
            compare this thesis' extension with the implementation from
            \cite{wendenius_gradient-free_2023} and state-of-the-art QML
            optimizers
