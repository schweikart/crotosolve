	title = {Gradient-free Optimization of Parameterized Quantum Circuits},
	abstract = {Currently, parameterized quantum circuits are commonly trained by classical optimizers and by applying the parameter-shift rule to determine gradients. In this way, the pipeline and the workflow established in classical machine learning are directly transferred to quantum computing. In our work, we present an approach to train parameterized quantum circuits by taking advantage of quantum-specific properties. Specifically, we exploit that the influence of a parameterized rotational gate on the expectation value of a quantum circuit can be represented by a sine wave. By determining this sine wave with a minimum number of circuit evaluations, we are able to directly set the parameters to their optimal value in the current circuit configuration. Iterating this process over all learnable parameters allows for a rapid decrease in training loss. We briefly present the theoretical background of our approach, investigate practical implications, and perform experiments on several circuits used
in the literature. Our results show that we can consistently outperform established and widely used optimizers.},

	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church–Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

	abstract = {Abstract Parameterized quantum circuits ({PQCs}) play an essential role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is choosing an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and parameter count. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, circuits, several descriptors are proposed, including expressibility and entangling capability, that are statistically estimated from classical simulations. These descriptors are computed for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From these simulations, circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors are identified. In particular, a substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement, compared to that of those on a line, is observed. Furthermore, improvement in both descriptors is achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, it is investigated how expressibility “saturates” with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated value appear to be distinguishing features of a {PQC}. While the correlation between each descriptor and algorithm performance remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for algorithm development and design of experiments.},

Despite these successes, the proximity to the physical limits of chip fabrication alongside the increasing size of datasets is motivating a growing number of researchers to explore the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum computation to speed up classical {ML} algorithms. Here we review the literature in quantum {ML} and discuss perspectives for a mixed readership of classical {ML} and quantum computation experts. Particular emphasis will be placed on clarifying the limitations of quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best classical counterparts and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages for learning problems. Learning in the presence of noise and certain computationally hard problems in {ML} are identified as promising directions for the field. Practical questions, such as how to upload classical data into quantum form, will also be addressed.},
