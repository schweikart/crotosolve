Here we review the literature in quantum {ML} and discuss perspectives for a mixed readership of classical {ML} and quantum computation experts. Particular emphasis will be placed on clarifying the limitations of quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best classical counterparts and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages for learning problems. Learning in the presence of noise and certain computationally hard problems in {ML} are identified as promising directions for the field. Practical questions, such as how to upload classical data into quantum form, will also be addressed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Parameterized quantum circuits ({PQCs}) play an essential role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is choosing an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and parameter count. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, circuits, several descriptors are proposed, including expressibility and entangling capability, that are statistically estimated from classical simulations. These descriptors are computed for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From these simulations, circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors are identified. In particular, a substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement, compared to that of those on a line, is observed. Furthermore, improvement in both descriptors is achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, it is investigated how expressibility “saturates” with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated value appear to be distinguishing features of a {PQC}. While the correlation between each descriptor and algorithm performance remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for algorithm development and design of experiments.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church–Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

In this way, the pipeline and the workflow established in classical machine learning are directly transferred to quantum computing. In our work, we present an approach to train parameterized quantum circuits by taking advantage of quantum-specific properties. Specifically, we exploit that the influence of a parameterized rotational gate on the expectation value of a quantum circuit can be represented by a sine wave. By determining this sine wave with a minimum number of circuit evaluations, we are able to directly set the parameters to their optimal value in the current circuit configuration. Iterating this process over all learnable parameters allows for a rapid decrease in training loss. We briefly present the theoretical background of our approach, investigate practical implications, and perform experiments on several circuits used
in the literature. Our results show that we can consistently outperform established and widely used optimizers.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a neural approach to reconstructing rooted tree graphs describing hierarchical interactions, using a novel representation we term the lowest common ancestor generations ({LCAG}) matrix. This compact formulation is equivalent to the adjacency matrix, but enables learning a tree’s structure from its leaves alone without the prior assumptions required if using the adjacency matrix directly. Employing the {LCAG} therefore enables the first end-to-end trainable solution which learns the hierarchical structure of varying tree sizes directly, using only the terminal tree leaves to do so. In the case of high-energy particle physics, a particle decay forms a hierarchical tree structure of which only the final products can be observed experimentally, and the large combinatorial space of possible trees makes an analytic solution intractable. We demonstrate the use of the {LCAG} as a target in the task of predicting simulated particle physics decay structures using both a Transformer encoder and a neural relational inference encoder graph neural network. With this approach, we are able to correctly predict the {LCAG} purely from leaf features for a maximum tree-depth of 8 in of cases for trees up to 6 leaves (including) and for trees up to 10 in our simulated dataset.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a neural approach to reconstructing rooted tree graphs describing hierarchical interactions, using a novel representation we term the lowest common ancestor generations ({LCAG}) matrix. This compact formulation is equivalent to the adjacency matrix, but enables learning a tree’s structure from its leaves alone without the prior assumptions required if using the adjacency matrix directly. Employing the {LCAG} therefore enables the first end-to-end trainable solution which learns the hierarchical structure of varying tree sizes directly, using only the terminal tree leaves to do so. In the case of high-energy particle physics, a particle decay forms a hierarchical tree structure of which only the final products can be observed experimentally, and the large combinatorial space of possible trees makes an analytic solution intractable. We demonstrate the use of the {LCAG} as a target in the task of predicting simulated particle physics decay structures using both a Transformer encoder and a neural relational inference encoder graph neural network. With this approach, we are able to correctly predict the {LCAG} purely from leaf features for a maximum tree-depth of 8 in of cases for trees up to 6 leaves (including) and for trees up to 10 in our simulated dataset.},

	abstract = {Fork has long been the process creation system call for Unix. At its inception, fork was hailed as an efficient system call due to its use of copy-on-write on memory shared between parent and child processes. However, application memory demand has increased drastically since the early days and the cost incurred by fork to simply set up virtual memory (e.g., copy page tables) is now a concern, even for applications that only require hundreds of {MBs} of memory. In practice, fork performance already holds back system efficiency and latency across a range of uses cases that fork large processes, such as fault-tolerant systems, serverless frameworks, and testing frameworks.This paper proposes On-demand-fork, a fast implementation of the fork system call specifically designed for applications with large memory footprints. On-demand-fork relies on the observation that copy-on-write can be generalized to page tables, even on commodity hardware. On-demand-fork executes faster than the traditional fork implementation by additionally sharing page tables between parent and child at fork time and selectively copying page tables in small chunks, on-demand, when handling page faults. On-demand-fork is a drop-in replacement for fork that requires no changes to applications or hardware.We evaluated On-demand-fork on a range of micro-benchmarks and real-world workloads. On-demand-fork significantly reduces the fork invocation time and has improved scalability. For processes with 1 {GB} of allocated memory, On-demand-fork has a 65× performance advantage over Fork. We also evaluated On-demand-fork on testing, fuzzing, and snapshotting workloads of well-known applications, obtaining execution throughput improvements between 59\% and 226\% and up to 99\% invocation latency reduction.},

Our metrics are designed for evaluating the relative maturity of a prototype system or compatibility layer, and this paper focuses on compatibility with Linux applications. This study uses a combination of static analysis to understand {API} usage and survey data to weight the relative importance of applications to end users.This paper yields several insights for developers and researchers, which are useful for assessing the complexity and security of Linux {APIs}. For example, every Ubuntu installation requires 224 system calls, 208 ioctl, fcntl, and prctl codes and hundreds of pseudo files. For each {API} type, a significant number of {APIs} are rarely used, if ever. Moreover, several security-relevant {API} changes, such as replacing access with faccessat, have met with slow adoption. Finally, hundreds of libc interfaces are effectively unused, yielding opportunities to improve security and efficiency by restructuring libc.},

While {OSes} and applications have evolved tremendously over the last 25 years, {POSIX}, and the basic set of abstractions it provides, has remained largely unchanged. Little has been done to measure how and to what extent traditional {POSIX} abstractions are being used in modern {OSes}, and whether new abstractions are taking form, dethroning traditional ones. We explore these questions through a study of {POSIX} usage in modern desktop and mobile {OSes}: Android, {OS} X, and Ubuntu. Our results show that new abstractions are taking form, replacing several prominent traditional abstractions in {POSIX}. While the changes are driven by common needs and are conceptually similar across the three {OSes}, they are not converging on any new standard, increasing fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, {MPS}) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, {isoTNS}) tensor network methods2,3 break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications4,5.},

	isbn = {978-3-031-37963-5},
	abstract = {Optimization problems are ubiquitous in various industrial settings, and multi-knapsack optimization is one recurrent task faced daily by several industries. The advent of quantum computing has opened a new paradigm for computationally intensive tasks, with promises of delivering better and faster solutions for specific classes of problems. This work presents a comprehensive study of quantum computing approaches for multi-knapsack problems, by investigating some of the most prominent and state-of-the-art quantum algorithms using different quantum software and hardware tools. The performance of the quantum approaches is compared for varying hyperparameters. We consider several gate-based quantum algorithms, such as {QAOA} and {VQE}, as well as quantum annealing, and present an exhaustive study of the solutions and the estimation of runtimes. Additionally, we analyze the impact of warm-starting {QAOA} to understand the reasons for the better performance of this approach. We discuss the implications of our results in view of utilizing quantum optimization for industrial applications in the future. In addition to the high demand for better quantum hardware, our results also emphasize the necessity of more and better quantum optimization algorithms, especially for multi-knapsack problems.},
