	title = {Gradient-free Optimization of Parameterized Quantum Circuits},
	abstract = {Currently, parameterized quantum circuits are commonly trained by classical optimizers and by applying the parameter-shift rule to determine gradients. In this way, the pipeline and the workflow established in classical machine learning are directly transferred to quantum computing. In our work, we present an approach to train parameterized quantum circuits by taking advantage of quantum-specific properties. Specifically, we exploit that the influence of a parameterized rotational gate on the expectation value of a quantum circuit can be represented by a sine wave. By determining this sine wave with a minimum number of circuit evaluations, we are able to directly set the parameters to their optimal value in the current circuit configuration. Iterating this process over all learnable parameters allows for a rapid decrease in training loss. We briefly present the theoretical background of our approach, investigate practical implications, and perform experiments on several circuits used
in the literature. Our results show that we can consistently outperform established and widely used optimizers.},

	doi = {10.1098/rspa.1985.0070},
	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church–Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},
