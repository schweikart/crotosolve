	title = {Gradient-free Optimization of Parameterized Quantum Circuits},
	abstract = {Currently, parameterized quantum circuits are commonly trained by classical optimizers and by applying the parameter-shift rule to determine gradients. In this way, the pipeline and the workflow established in classical machine learning are directly transferred to quantum computing. In our work, we present an approach to train parameterized quantum circuits by taking advantage of quantum-specific properties. Specifically, we exploit that the influence of a parameterized rotational gate on the expectation value of a quantum circuit can be represented by a sine wave. By determining this sine wave with a minimum number of circuit evaluations, we are able to directly set the parameters to their optimal value in the current circuit configuration. Iterating this process over all learnable parameters allows for a rapid decrease in training loss. We briefly present the theoretical background of our approach, investigate practical implications, and perform experiments on several circuits used
in the literature. Our results show that we can consistently outperform established and widely used optimizers.},
